## Setup and Use

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A command line interface like Terminal or GitBash to set up and run the project
- MySQL 8.0.19, following [these pinned installation instructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20210521163651/https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql)
- A web browser to view and interact with the project

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/TorchAblaze/Favorful.Solution.git`
2. Navigate to the `Favorful` directory on your computer
3. Open with your preferred text editor to view the code base
4. To setup a SQL database using MySQL:
   - Create an `appsettings.json` file in the `Favorful` directory
   - Copy the text box below and paste into the `appsettings.json` file, replacing `<password>` with your MySQL password:
   ```
     {
        "ConnectionStrings": {
           "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=tiffany_greathead;uid=root;pwd=<password>;"
         }
     }
   ```
   - Open your terminal and run the command: `mysql -uroot -p<mysql_password>` (replace `<mysql_password>` with your MySQL password) to launch MySQL server
5. To serve the local web app:

- Navigate to `Favorful.Solution/Favorful` in your command line
- Run the commands:
  - `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies that are listed in `Favorful.csproj`
  - `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -v 5.0.0`
  - `dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql -v 5.0.0-alpha.2`
  - `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies -v 5.0.0`
  - `dotnet build` to build the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries
  - `dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore -v 5.0.0`
  - `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` to install EF Core tools
  - `dotnet ef database update`
- Finally, run the command `dotnet run` to run the project!
- Note: `dotnet run` also restores and builds the project, so you can use this single command to start the console app

6. Visit the application via web browser at: `localhost:5000/`
